### Passive v. Active Voice

> Passive: I was **hit** by the _ball_.

> Active: The _ball_ **hit** me.

For an active voice: the _subject_ comes before the **noun**.

### Tenses

 &nbsp; run v. running

Just be consistent (ed: I already feel strongly about this)

#    ## Perspective/POV (Narrative mode)

 &nbsp; 1st: I ..<br>
 &nbsp; 2nd: You ..<br>
 &nbsp; 3rd: They/The boy ..<br>

Just be consistent (ed: I already feel strongly about this)

### Cliché

Just don't.

Be fresh, it's booooooring. Try using your own words.

### Economy of Language/Wordiness

Don't add words just for the sake of it.

Mind your _adverbs and adjectives_:<br>
 - does that descriptor need to be there?<br>
 - is it serving a purpose?

Err on the side of active voice.
