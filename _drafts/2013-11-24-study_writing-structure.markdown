I'd been having problems ploughing through a lot of ~handwavey "great writer" rubbish.

Finally! Some real nuts-and-bolts technique.

Thank you Nina Powell!

### Which of these sentences are better?

A: ```This is an interesting, but somewhat flawed essay from a creative student.```

B: ```This creative student has produced an interesting, but somewhat flawed essay.```

C: ```This creative student has produced a somewhat flawed but interesting essay.```


People expect important information late.

Context at the beginning, emphasis at the end.

Important information should be put in the stress position. Which is at the end.

Based on this logic and adhering to these rules the _final_ statement is preferred.

### Rewrite This

#### Context and Emphasis

Example:

``` An increase in heart rate occurred. ```

Rearranging to put the important information in the stress position:

``` Heart rate increased. ```

(context) (emphasis)

#### Subject and Verb

Example:

``` An increase in heart rate occurred. ```

_subject_: [increase] <br>
_verb_: [occurred]

Rearranging so the verb expresses the action:

``` Heart rate increased. ```

_subject_: [heart rate]<br>
_verb_: [increase]

#### Misplaced object displacing actual object

Example:

``` The new drug caused a decrease in heart rate. ```

_object_: [decrease] <br>
_pre-positional phrase_: [in heart rate]

Rearranging to emphasise true object:

``` The new drug decreased heart rate. ```

_object_: [heart rate]
