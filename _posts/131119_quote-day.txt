Thank you Philip Adams interviewing Magda Szubanksi.

It's a real "This is you Life" interview, but they discuss the love and admiration of "mongrels". As a complete half-breed mongrel myself this has warmed my cockels.

Philip provided the amazing quote:
'In the beef industry mongrels are known as "Hybrid Vigor"'.

47% are apparently 1st gen or less.

Having a really hard day today, need all the strong I can get.

Also media concept: "Thrill of Recognition" (talking about lowbrow sitcoms).
