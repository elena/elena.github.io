This is actually my second quote of today but don't tell anyone.

Same credits though: Late Night Live talking about [Life and Happiness][lnl]

Believe it or not the internet doesn't have the quote as I heard it but it goes something like:

{% highlight sh %}
  Night conceals the world,
    but reveals the universe.
{% endhighlight %}

Isn't that lovely.

The quote is discussed deep in to the hour long podcast.
