`disintermediation`

`dɪsˌɪntəˌmiːdɪˈeɪʃən`


In economics, disintermediation is the removal of intermediaries in a supply chain, or "cutting out the middleman". Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediate (such as a distributor, wholesaler, broker, or agent), companies may now deal with every customer directly, for example via the Internet. One important factor is a drop in the cost of servicing customers directly.

Uh-oh. Someone has gone on a TEDTalk binge. Was doing pycon and went off piste.

Late this arvo discovered the [TEDxWallStreet](http://tedxwallstreet.com/category/videos/) videos and had that usual combination of revulsion and compulsion.

The context of this word is then easy to imagine but specifically was from an OK talk about "crowdsourced capitalism" by a guy who really does not understand what that term means. But his use of **disintermediation** (or he might have even said **disintermediary**) just impressed me.

So, what talks **did** I like?

Well all these guys I wanted to hate as rich older white males ("fitting a stereotype with those guys"), yet annoyingly seemed to be talking reason:

The first guy in particular, I was like "here we go", but they all seem to recognise that there is badness going on and that's interesting to know.

*Warning*: these talks are very businessy.
