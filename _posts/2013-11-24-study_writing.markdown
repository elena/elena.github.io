Woke up today, was productive for a little while then became obsessed by wanting to be able to write more gooderer.

I've always written myself off as a bad writer, but the idea of leaving this notion behind and actually learning and practicing to become better has been on my mind lately. I've needed to be able to express myself and it would be useful if I had this skill for some of the projects that I'm on.

I know have 'my own' voice, so this isn't a problem. My vocabulary is erring on brobdingnagian, so that's fine too. I was conscious during English classes in highschool and tended to do well so remember some basic rules. I feel strongly about the grammar that I know though am aware that there are a lot of these rules that I do not know.

Firstly I think I just need to change my attitude. To defend myself I say that I write poorly: I use the term "Elena-speak" for that wordy waffle I'm prone to. And I use "I" too much (which is a confidence thing).

One of the journalists in the Django community said practice, practice, practice.

This is a conscious step towards that pursuit.

This is one of the cases where having your work assessed is useful, that is to say actually doing a course.

My initial beginner's researcher:

### Passive v. Active Voice

> Passive: I was **hit** by the _ball_.

> Active: The _ball_ **hit** me.

For an active voice: the _subject_ comes before the **noun**.

### Tenses

 &nbsp; run v. running

Just be consistent (ed: I already feel strongly about this)

#    ## Perspective/POV (Narrative mode)

 &nbsp; 1st: I ..<br>
 &nbsp; 2nd: You ..<br>
 &nbsp; 3rd: They/The boy ..<br>

Just be consistent (ed: I already feel strongly about this)

### Clich√©

Just don't.

Be fresh, it's booooooring. Try using your own words.

### Economy of Language/Wordiness

Don't add words just for the sake of it.

Mind your _adverbs and adjectives_:<br>
 - does that descriptor need to be there?<br>
 - is it serving a purpose?

Err on the side of active voice.
