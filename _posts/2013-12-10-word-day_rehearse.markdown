The what now?!

That man! What an orater, so articulate.

At ~2:40 he throws away this word by its **fourth** use.

" ... I think it's an excellent thing that there's no need to believe the absurd propositions that I, admittedly rather briefly **rehearsed** to you."

I don't recall ever having heard this word used like this before! Wow. You are missed Mr. Hitchens.

Moreover he uses the words *[Necrocracy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/necrocracy)* and *[Thanatocracy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thanatocracy)* (both of which could easily have been words of the day in their own right, though they kind of mean the same thing) and the quote " ... but at least you can fucking die and leave North Korea.\*" (~4:10) to **that** audience. What a guy.

So. That's the first thing ... "
