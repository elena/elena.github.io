Have been looking for Public Domain music as opening theme for youtubes. Have perfect bit of tune that I want to use, but it's from a small indie American band. Not even sure if they're signed with a big label. Only want to use some seconds, sigh. Permission being sought. Not sure what kind of luck I'm going to have.

Through the disappointment and wading through heaps of quite 2nd rate public domain music came up with is probably the best, most balanced and ultimate solution:

Use my friend [Dave's](http://davepretty.com/) music :) He's a talented musician *and* was the person who really got me in to all of this in the first place.

No more copyright concerns!
